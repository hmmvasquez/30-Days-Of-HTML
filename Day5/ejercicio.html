            I have been creating <i>challenges</i> since <b>November 22, 2019</b>. Since then I have create four challenges such as <em>30 Days of HTML, 30 Days of JavaScript, 30 days of Python, 30 days of React</em>. The <mark>30 Days of JavaScript</mark> is the most popular among the four challenges. While I was preparing this challenges, I was taking los of caffeine (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) but I didn't take any <del>beer</del>  (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) instead I was taking more <u>juice</u>. Do yu think the comparison is correct, 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 ? If you answer is yes, then you know <u>exponential</u>.
